# react-pwa-demo
This is the demo app for my blog article [How To Turn a Server-side-rendered React SPA into a PWA](https://sunkanqiang.com/how-to-turn-ssr-react-spa-into-pwa/)

## How To Start

git clone the project, then
```
npm install

npm run start
```

The app will be running in `localhost:3000`.

If you need to make some changes, you can do this in dev mode

```
npm run dev
```
